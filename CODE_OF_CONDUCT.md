SIEM integrations with enterprise-grade logical 
SIEM-specific configurations for enhanced detection and automated incident response. Below, I’ll outline a complete architecture for high-security environments, using **Elastic Stack**, **Splunk**, and **QRadar** with complex detection rules and multi-stage attack pattern matching.

### **1. Advanced SIEM Detection: Multi-Stage Attack Detection using MITRE ATT&CK**
This solution monitors for a sequence of behaviors based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. For example, it can detect a potential attack chain comprising `Initial Access → Privilege Escalation → Lateral Movement

Python + Splunk Implementation: Multi-Stage Detection with Correlation Analysis**

Features:
- Correlates multiple suspicious events across different logs.
- Uses state-based detection (maintains attack context).
- Sends alerts to SIEM or triggers automated playbooks.

python
import requests
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

 Splunk Configuration
splunk_url = "https://splunk-server:8089/services/search/jobs"
splunk_token = "YOUR_SPLUNK_API_TOKEN"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {splunk_token}"}

MITRE ATT&CK Stages
attack_chain = {
    "Initial Access": {"query": "search index=main sourcetype=windows:security EventCode=4625", "state": False, "timestamp": None},
    "Privilege Escalation": {"query": "search index=main sourcetype=windows:security EventCode=4672", "state": False, "timestamp": None},
    "Lateral Movement": {"query": "search index=main sourcetype=windows:security EventCode=4624", "state": False, "timestamp": None}
}

 Define the correlation window (e.g., 30 mins)
correlation_window = timedelta(minutes=30)

Function to execute Splunk queries
def splunk_query(query):
    payload = {"search": query, "output_mode": "json"}
    response = requests.post(splunk_url, headers=headers, data=payload, verify=False)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        job_id = response.json()["sid"]
        return job_id
    else:
        print(f"[!] Splunk query failed: {response.text}")
        return None

Function to check for attack stages in the logs
def check_attack_stage(stage):
    job_id = splunk_query(attack_chain[stage]["query"])
    if job_id:
        # Check job status
        status_url = f"{splunk_url}/{job_id}/results"
        time.sleep(5)  # Allow some time for Splunk to process the query
        response = requests.get(status_url, headers=headers, verify=False)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            results = response.json()["results"]
            if results:
                attack_chain[stage]["state"] = True
                attack_chain[stage]["timestamp"] = datetime.utcnow()
                print(f"[+] Stage '{stage}' detected at {attack_chain[stage]['timestamp']}.")
        else:
            print(f"[!] Failed to get results for job {job_id}")
    else:
        print("[!] No job ID returned for the query.")

Function to correlate multi-stage attacks
def correlate_attack_chain():
    print("[*] Correlating attack stages based on MITRE ATT&CK framework...")
    initial_access = attack_chain["Initial Access"]["timestamp"]
    privilege_escalation = attack_chain["Privilege Escalation"]["timestamp"]
    lateral_movement = attack_chain["Lateral Movement"]["timestamp"]

    if all([initial_access, privilege_escalation, lateral_movement]):
        if (privilege_escalation - initial_access) <= correlation_window and (lateral_movement - privilege_escalation) <= correlation_window:
            print("[!] Multi-stage attack detected! Possible APT detected.")
            # Trigger alert or automated response
            alert_payload = {
                "time": str(datetime.utcnow().timestamp()),
                "event": "Multi-stage attack detected. Potential APT activity.",
                "attack_chain": attack_chain
            }
            requests.post(splunk_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(alert_payload))
            reset_attack_chain()  # Reset after detection
        else:
            print("[*] No correlation found within the given time window.")
    else:
        print("[*] Waiting for all attack stages to be detected...")

Function to reset the attack chain state
def reset_attack_chain():
    for stage in attack_chain:
        attack_chain[stage]["state"] = False
        attack_chain[stage]["timestamp"] = None

Main logic loop to periodically check each stage
while True:
    for stage in attack_chain:
        if not attack_chain[stage]["state"]:
            check_attack_stage(stage)
    correlate_attack_chain()
    time.sleep(60)  # Run the detection loop every 60 seconds


Key Points:
1. Correlates Events : Matches behavior patterns across different events (e.g., failed logins, privilege escalation).
2. Alerts on Complete Chain: Only triggers when all stages are met, reducing false positives.
3. Splunk Automation: Sends alerts to Splunk’s alerting module or triggers response actions.


2. Advanced Network Threat Detection with ML Integration (Python + Zeek + Scikit-Learn)
Use machine learning to analyze network traffic logs for anomalies that traditional rules might miss. This script uses Zeek’s network logs and Scikit-Learn’s anomaly detection models.

Features:
- Detects anomalous network patterns (e.g., data exfiltration).
- Uses unsupervised learning to adapt to changing environments.
- Can automatically tune its model based on new data.

python
import os
import json
import time
import joblib
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Define paths and files
zeek_log_dir = "/opt/zeek/logs/current"
http_log_file = os.path.join(zeek_log_dir, "http.log")

ElasticSearch Configuration
es = Elasticsearch(["https://elastic-server:9200"], http_auth=('elastic', 'password'), verify_certs=False)
index_name = "network-anomalies"

Load pre-trained ML model or train a new one
model_path = "/opt/siem/ml_model/isolation_forest.joblib"
if os.path.exists(model_path):
    print("[*] Loading pre-trained anomaly detection model...")
    model = joblib.load(model_path)
else:
    print("[*] Training a new anomaly detection model...")
    model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)  # Set contamination rate for anomalies

Function to extract network features from Zeek logs
def extract_features(http_log):
    features = []
    # Example features: Request size, response size, duration
    features.append(int(http_log.get("request_body_len", 0)))
    features.append(int(http_log.get("response_body_len", 0)))
    features.append(float(http_log.get("duration", 0.0)))
    return np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)

Monitor Zeek logs for new entries
def detect_anomalies():
    print("[*] Monitoring Zeek HTTP logs for anomalies...")
    with open(http_log_file, "r") as log_file:
        for line in log_file:
            try:
                # Parse JSON-formatted log entries
                http_log = json.loads(line)
                features = extract_features(http_log)
                # Predict if the current log is an anomaly
                prediction = model.predict(features)
                if prediction == -1:  # Anomalous entry
                    print(f"[!] Anomalous traffic detected: {http_log}")
                    es.index(index=index_name, body=http_log)  # Send alert to Elastic
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue

Start monitoring for network anomalies
detect_anomalies()


Key Points :
1. ML-Based Detection : Uses IsolationForest to flag outliers in network behavior.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracts specific features like request size, response size, and duration.
3. SIEM Integration : Pushes alerts to Elastic for correlation with other data sources.

Next Steps:
- Refine Models: Use a larger dataset to train more sophisticated models (e.g., clustering or deep learning).
- Expand MITRE ATT&CK Coverage: Integrate other ATT&CK techniques for comprehensive detection.
- SIEM Orchestration: Add automation playbooks for response (e.g., quarantine devices).
